# ModelSelection

This is an implementation of Bayesian model selection for linear
regression.

## Theory

See the [paper in ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04823) or the
source TeXmacs file in `doc/`.

## Dependencies

You'll need numpy and matplotlib. Both Python2 and 3 should work.

## Examples

* `src/LocalTests.py` contains some tests (yes, it's a weird file name).
* See `examples/` too.
